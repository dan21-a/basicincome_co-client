## http://basicincome.co

<b>Introduction</b>
Basicincome.co is a #DApp built on <a href="http://ripple.com">Ripple.com</a>. The #DApp is the brainchild of the young swedish prodigy Johan Nygren, and part of his philosophical work <a href="http://www.resilience.me/">How to Create Resilience</a>. Basicincome.co introduces some new concepts, such as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sosu1YsR_Wo">THE INCENTIVE LAYER</a>, <a href="http://graph.basicincome.co">peer-to-peer dividend pathways</a>, and hints at a future feature called <a href="http://www.resilience.me/whitepaper-decentralised-taxrate-governance.html">decentralized taxRate governance</a>.


<b>The design of http://basicincome.co right now:<b>
subscribes to all accounts that join the network, computes dividends, and accounts sign the dividends manually, at a somewhat regular interval. this design means that any currency that is transacted on the ripple network can be connected to my #DApp 

other #DApps integrate dividends in ripple-gateways, but they are then limited to the userbase of that gateway. by integrating it across the entire network, I reach everyone.

version 2.0 should be integrated directly with the ripple-protocol.
but working step by step :)
 http://connect.basicincome.co/#/  and http://client.basicincome.co  are both half-finished, but if my design are right then it´s really simple technologies,
and now that I´ve got some attention more people can join in and create them
 http://graph.basicincome.co  shows my peer-to-peer dividend pathway concepts, basically that safety net emerge from the sum of a persons
 financial transactions, and p2p, and this integrates really well with ripple
and then there´s the incentive layer, http://www.resilience.me/introduction-the-incentive-layer.html …
and there´s also a layer that adds natural selection to what % of dividend tax network clusters should use, but I skip that for version 1.0
