<b>Introduction</b>

Basicincome.co is a #DApp built on <a href="http://ripple.com">Ripple.com</a>. The #DApp is the brainchild of the young swedish prodigy Johan Nygren, and part of his philosophical work <a href="http://www.resilience.me/">How to Create Resilience</a>. Basicincome.co introduces some new concepts, such as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sosu1YsR_Wo">THE INCENTIVE LAYER</a>, <a href="http://graph.basicincome.co">peer-to-peer dividend pathways</a>, and hints at a future feature called <a href="http://www.resilience.me/whitepaper-decentralised-taxrate-governance.html">decentralized taxRate governance</a>.


<b>The design of Basicincome.co right now:<b>

The system is a bit of a hack. It uses Ripple API <a href="https://ripple.com/build/websocket-tool/#subscribe">subscribe</a> to create a dividend-network that mirrors the Ripple Network. This mirror network computes dividends on each transaction, and does all the magic. Each user has to sign in manually once in a while to declare tax. I have an old prototype client on <a href="http://client.resilience.me/">client.resilience.me/</a> that declares tax automatically. All in all, it´s really easy to create these technologies.

Because of this design, any currency that is transacted on the ripple network can be connected to my #DApp. Other #DApps integrate dividends via ripple-gateways (eg. <a href="http://rippledividend.com">rippledividend.com</a>), but they are then limited to the userbase of that gateway. By integrating it across the entire network, I reach everyone.

*version 2.0 should be integrated directly with the ripple-protocol.

<a href="http://graph.basicincome.co">graph.basicincome.co</a> shows my <i>peer-to-peer dividend pathway</i> concepts, basically that safety net emerge from the sum of a persons financial transactions, and p2p, and this integrates really well with <b>Ripple</b>.
There´s <a href="http://www.resilience.me/introduction-the-incentive-layer.html">the incentive layer</a>, something I´ve invented.

And there´s also a layer that adds natural selection to what % of dividend tax network clusters should use, but I skip that for version 1.0. I can rant about it and teach you about it if you want to, my ideas extend further then this app.
